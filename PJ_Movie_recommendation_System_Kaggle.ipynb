        "TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency) là 1 kĩ thuật sử dụng trong khai phá dữ liệu văn bản. Trọng số này được sử dụng để đánh giá tầm quan trọng của một từ trong một văn bản. Giá trị cao thể hiện độ quan trọng cao và nó phụ thuộc vào số lần từ xuất hiện trong văn bản nhưng bù lại bởi tần suất của từ đó trong tập dữ liệu. Một vài biến thể của tf-idf thường được sử dụng trong các hệ thống tìm kiếm như một công cụ chính để đánh giá và sắp xếp văn bản dựa vào truy vấn của người dùng.  Tf-idf cũng được sử dụng để lọc những từ stopwords trong các bài toán như tóm tắt văn bản và phân loại văn bản.\n",
