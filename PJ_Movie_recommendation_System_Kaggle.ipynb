The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple.

        "TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency) là 1 kĩ thuật sử dụng trong khai phá dữ liệu văn bản. Trọng số này được sử dụng để đánh giá tầm quan trọng của một từ trong một văn bản. Giá trị cao thể hiện độ quan trọng cao và nó phụ thuộc vào số lần từ xuất hiện trong văn bản nhưng bù lại bởi tần suất của từ đó trong tập dữ liệu. Một vài biến thể của tf-idf thường được sử dụng trong các hệ thống tìm kiếm như một công cụ chính để đánh giá và sắp xếp văn bản dựa vào truy vấn của người dùng.  Tf-idf cũng được sử dụng để lọc những từ stopwords trong các bài toán như tóm tắt văn bản và phân loại văn bản.\n",

        "TF là gì?\n",
        "TF: Term Frequency(Tần suất xuất hiện của từ) là số lần từ xuất hiện trong văn bản. Vì các văn bản có thể có độ dài ngắn khác nhau nên một số từ có thể xuất hiện nhiều lần trong một văn bản dài hơn là một văn bản ngắn. Như vậy, term frequency thường được chia cho độ dài văn bản( tổng số từ trong một văn bản).\n",

Nhưng  một số từ như “is”, “of” và “that” thường xuất hiện rất nhiều lần nhưng độ quan trọng là không cao. Như thế chúng ta cần giảm độ quan trọng của những từ này xuống."

Take a look at the above table again. Although there is only one user that rated both Matrix and Titanic rated, the similarity between them is 1. In extreme cases, we can have millions of users and the similarity between two fairly different movies could be very high simply because they have similar rank for the only user who ranked them both."

Essentially, we map each user and each item into a latent space with dimension r. Therefore, it helps us better understand the relationship between users and items as they become directly comparable.
