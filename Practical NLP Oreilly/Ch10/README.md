1. **[BioBERT](https://github.com/practical-nlp/practical-nlp/blob/master/Ch10/01_BioBERT_Demo.ipynb)**: Here we demonstrate how to load and use BioBERT which is a pre-trained bio-medical language representation model for various bio-medical text mining tasks perform the task of text classification.

2. **[FinBERT](https://github.com/practical-nlp/practical-nlp/blob/master/Ch10/02_FinBERT.ipynb)**: Here we demonstrate how to load and use FinBERT and perform the task of text classification. It is built by further training the BERT language model in the finance domain, using a large financial corpus.
